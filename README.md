Assignment 4.1: For this assingment I had to make a loop inside a function that could be called back 
with a changeable aspect. I ended up making a flower that could have it's location, size, and pedal 
colors changed. I was going to make the amount of pedals chang-able too, but I couln't figure out how to 
make it look good. I also struggled a bit with making the flower look like a FLOWER. I just had to change 
the ellipseMode to CORNER, to make it look good. Overall, I had an easy time with this assignment.

Assignment 4.2: For this assignment, I had to take the sprite made in the previous assignment and turn
it into a 2D pattern. This pattern had to consist of multiple srites. Since my call back only changed 
the colors and size, I wanted it to change the number of pedals. I tried to do this is 4.1 but I could
not make it work. Suprisngly, I figured it out quickly for this assignment. I had a bit of trouble making
the initial pattern, but once I did, I quickly reapted the pattern across the screen using loops in draw().
