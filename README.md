Assignment 4 README

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 4.1: For this assingment I had to make a loop inside a function that could be called back 
with a changeable aspect. I ended up making a flower that could have it's location, size, and pedal 
colors changed. I was going to make the amount of pedals chang-able too, but I couln't figure out how to 
make it look good. I also struggled a bit with making the flower look like a FLOWER. I just had to change 
the ellipseMode to CORNER, to make it look good. Overall, I had an easy time with this assignment.

Assignment 4.2: For this assignment, I had to take the sprite made in the previous assignment and turn
it into a 2D pattern. This pattern had to consist of multiple srites. Since my call back only changed 
the colors and size, I wanted it to change the number of pedals. I tried to do this is 4.1 but I could
not make it work. Suprisngly, I figured it out quickly for this assignment. I had a bit of trouble making
the initial pattern, but once I did, I quickly reapted the pattern across the screen using loops in draw().

Assignment 4.3: For this assignment I had to duplicate assignment 4.2 and make it have random attributes 
so that eevrytime you refresh the code, it is different. I could either change the existing sprite and/or
add another random object. I decided to change what I already had. I was going to make the flowers all
rotate randomly everytime, but it didn't look different enough everytime so I scraped that idea. Instead
I had the colors of all 3 flowers change from different shades of red and pink, I also made the big flower
in the middle random sizes evertime (scaled 0.5 to 1). This defintly made it different everytime and I'm 
happy I changed color and size instead. I also changed the background from pink to a custom light green color

Assignment 4.4: For this assignment I had to make the random elements from the previous assignment, a set 
array so they change each time the drawFlower() appears. This assignment was realitivly simple, I just had
to change the loop to change what part of the array it was I had with the i (or j) of the loop. After chang-
ing from random to a set number, I just had to fige out how I wanted it to look astheticly. I changed the 
size of the middle flowers only and i went with a bunch of diffirent size, but eventually setteled on 0.6
to 1.1. I made all the flowers go from darkred to pink. I think it ended up looking pretty cool
