Assignment 4.1: For this assingment I had to make a loop inside a function that could be called back 
with oen changeable aspect. I ended up making a flower that could have it'slocation, size, and pedal 
colors changed. I was going to make the amount of pedals chang-able too, but I couln't figure out how to 
make it look good. I also struggled a bit with making the flow look like a FLOWER. I just had to change 
the ellipseMode to CORNER, to make it look good. Overall, I had an easy time with this assignment.
